# AI Declarations
As part of the **A-AiAssisted** increment, I tried using AI as a partner to improve the quality of my code and insert a new feature. Below details what was used, how it helped and any other observations.

## Tools Used
- Windsurf IDE
- SWE-1.5 Model
- Claude Code


### Improved Code Quality
As I never used AI IDEs and such AI-assisted coding before, I read some tutorials online and experimented around with Windsurf. To attempt to improve code quality, I used the Plan feature in Windsurf and requested for it to generate a plan to improve my code quality, specifically in the aspects of Readability, Reduce Method Complexity, Reduce Nesting, etc.

It generated a comprehensive plan for me in which I checked and implemented it in phases.



Keep it updated with a record of your use of AI tools
(e.g., which tool you used for which increment), 
and interesting observations 
    (e.g., what worked? what didn't? overall, how much time did it save?)
